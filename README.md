# Hand Gesture Recognition
A Quantization-based position Weight Matrix (QuPWM) feature extraction method for mult-iclass classification is proposed to improve the interpretation of biomedical signals. This method is validated on surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signals recognition for eight different hand gestures.
